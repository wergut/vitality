          <h3>What Is Testosterone?</h3>
          <p>Testosterone is the primary hormone responsible for developing and regulating various male physical processes and sexual characteristics. As males grow, the testicles produce testosterone and release the hormone, allowing it to travel until it attaches to androgen receptors in the body to promote protein synthesis and send messages to generate tissue. With these anabolic messages, testosterone can prompt muscle growth and bone mass, increasing strength and density. During this process, testosterone can also send androgenic messages to regulate male characteristics such as reproduction, sex drive, facial hair growth, cell production, and fat distribution.</p>
          <p>Once testosterone is released, the brain and pituitary gland are primarily responsible for controlling a man’s testosterone levels. However, over time, the brain and the pituitary gland will eventually produce less testosterone as men age, with testosterone levels declining by 1% yearly. Depending on your physiology, those declining testosterone levels can hugely affect the androgenic and anabolic characteristics that dictate a man’s “masculinity,” eventually causing a range of age-related symptoms. For example, men with low levels of testosterone or Low T typically experience decreased sex drive, low energy, brittle bones, rapid weight gain, and muscle weakness.</p>
          <p>Although most men over 40 usually view the symptoms as a natural part of aging, many are unaware that low testosterone may be the underlying cause for many of these issues. However, whether or not you are experiencing age-related symptoms, it is important to have your testosterone levels regularly checked as you continue to get older. A simple blood test can help gauge how much testosterone a man has by measuring the body’s two main types of testosterone: free testosterone and total testosterone.</p>
          <p>Most of the testosterone in our bodies is attached to two essential proteins: albumin and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). However, some of the testosterone will remain unattached to any proteins, thus leaving it “free” for use at any time. Physicians commonly refer to this as “free testosterone.” Of course, “total testosterone” is exactly what it sounds like; it includes the “total” amount of both attached and free testosterone residing in the body.</p>
          <p>To determine your total testosterone range, physicians will measure your free and attached testosterone. Depending on your symptoms, physicians may only view your free testosterone levels to diagnose certain conditions. In either case, knowing the range of your testosterone levels can help you and your physician decide on the next steps in treatment.</p>

          <h3>What Are Normal Testosterone Levels in Men by Age?</h3>
          <p>Although testosterone levels can greatly differ depending on the individual, there is a recognized standard for what is considered an “average” testosterone level for men. Typically, the normal testosterone levels in males range from 300 to 1,000 nanograms per deciliter (ng/dl), or 10 to 35 nanomoles per liter by the time they reach adulthood.</p>
          <p>As boys grow and become men, their testosterone levels usually change at each stage of growth and development, reinforcing their physical and sexual characteristics during each transition. However, most men do not share the same experiences during these transitions, and in some cases, their testosterone levels can be either higher or lower than the average male in their age range.</p>
          <h5>Children</h5>
          <p>Typically, male children between the ages of 6 months and nine years have a range between 7 and 20 ng/dl of testosterone. However, by the time they reach 11 years old, the high end of that range can increase to 130 ng/dl, and as they speed towards their teenage years, that number rises to 800 ng/do by the time they reach the ages of 12 and 13.</p>
          <h5>Teens</h5>
          <p>At 14 years old, most teenage boys begin to feel the full effects of puberty as their testosterone levels spike upwards to 1,200 ng/dl, and they experience noticeable changes such as increased muscle mass and a deeper voice. Usually, the high end of testosterone levels remains steady at 1200 ng/dl, while the low end begins to grow from 7 to 100 ng/dl between the ages of 15 and 16. By the time most males are between the ages of 17 and 18, the low end of their testosterone levels will increase once again, with the range changing from 300 to 1,200 ng/dl.</p>
          <p>But once puberty is over, male testosterone levels slowly decrease and balance out. By age 19, the average male will usually have testosterone levels ranging from 240 to 950 ng/dl, which will typically remain the same for most men throughout their 20s and 30s.</p>
          <p>However, it is not abnormal for some men in their 20s to experience early andropause, in which their testosterone levels drastically drop below the normal range. During this time, younger men can experience common Low T symptoms such as sexual dysfunction, higher fat concentration, and reduced muscle mass.</p>

          <h5>Signs of High T </h5>
          <p>Similar to males with testosterone deficiencies, men with abnormally high levels of testosterone usually exhibit a range of common symptoms, which include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Excessive body hair</li>
            <li>Prostate enlargement</li>
            <li>High blood pressure</li>
            <li>Unexplained weight gain</li>
